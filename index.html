             <br>Sir, I'm a bit nervous</br>
             'Bout being here today</br>
             Still not real sure of what I'm going to say</br>
             So bare with me please</br>
             If I take up too much of your time</br>
             
             <br>But you see, in this box is a ring for your oldest</br>
             She's my everything and all that I know is</br>
             It would be such a relief if I knew that we were on the same side</br>
             'Cause very soon I'm hoping that I</br>
             
             </br>Can marry your daughter</br>
             And make her my wife</br>
             I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life</br>
             And give her the best of me 'til the day that I die, yeah</br>
             
           </br>  I'm gonna marry your princess</nr>
             And make her my queen</br>
             She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen</br>
             I can't wait to smile</br>
             As she walks down the aisle</br>
             On the arm of her father</br>
             On the day that I marry your daughter</br>
             
            </br> She's been hear every step since the day that we met</br>
             (I'm scared to death to think of what would happen if she ever left)</br>
             So don't you ever worry about me ever treating her bad, no</br>
             We've got most of our vows done so far (so bring on the better or worse)</br>
             And 'til death do us part</br>
             There's no doubt in my mind</br>
             It's time</br>
             I'm ready to start</br>
             I swear to you with all of my heart</br>
             
             </br>I'm gonna marry your daughter</br>
             And make her my wife</br>
             I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life</br>
             And give her the best of me 'til the day that I die, oh</br>
             
           </br>  I'm gonna marry your princess</br>
             And make her my queen</br>
             She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen</br>
             I can't wait to smile</br>
             As she walks down the aisle</br>
             On the arm of her father</br>
             On the day that I marry your daughter</br>
             
           </br>  I'm gonna marry your daughter</br>
             And make her my wife</br>
